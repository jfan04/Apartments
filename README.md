# Apartments

1. The web application includes two views: the list view (as illustrated in the image) displaying all the apartments, and the detail view showing the details about each apartment. When clicking on the title of each apartment in the list view, it switches to the detail view. The detail view is not provided with specific UI design, so feel free to use any design, or you can simply display the clicked apartment title in the detail view.
2. Please use a JSON file to load the apartment data, and use it to display the UI elements dynamically. An example json file is provided ( apartment.json ), but feel free to modify the JSON structure or values to satisfy your need. Some apartment images are given for your convenience ( image-1.jpg, image-2.jpg, etc ), but feel free to use any images you can find.
3. Your application is required to support pagination. You need to display 12 apartments in total with 5 apartments per page.
4. The apartment list can be sorted descendingly by price or popularity by clicking on the related buttons

● Required : The application must be implemented using plain HTML+CSS+JavaScript or any CSS+JavaScript frameworks.
● Required : The main entry file is named index.html and can be served using any simple HTTP servers. NO server side scripts (e.g. php, jsp, python, ruby...) are needed.
● Required : The implementation needs to support the latest version of Chrome, Safari, and IE.
● Optional : We recommend the use of Bootstrap and AngularJs to speed up your implementation, but it is totally fine to use plain HTML/CSS/JS, or any CSS or JavaScript framework you are most familiar with.
● Optional : Supporting responsive design on mobile devices are a big bonus, but not required.
